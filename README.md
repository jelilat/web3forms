# Web3 Forms 

Web3 Forms is a no-code online form builder that lets you create token-gated forms with ease. 

Token gating is a common tool used by Crypto project teams to create value for community members. It allows projects to reward people who hold their tokens by creating exclusive content, events, and other benefits available only to token holders.

For example, you can create an online form that can only be filled by those who own at least 1 BAYC NFT.

Imagine you want to create a Newsletter that drops alphas or trading strategies to those who buy your NFT. Or you want to create a paid newsletter subscription. You can do all of these with Web3 Forms.

The features include:

* Online form builder.
* Token-gated forms.
* Paid subscription.
* Limited access subscription, etc.
